# The repository of WebMea
We proposed and implemented WebMea, a Google Chrome extension that can measure both web content and HTTP(S) traffic, as a baseline Google Chrome extension for researchers to construct their extension-based crawlers.
More details of the design, implementation, and customization of WebMea are provided in our paper **WebMea: A Google Chrome Extension for Web Security and Privacy Measurement Studies**.
